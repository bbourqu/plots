## Starting a Digital Garden

I wanted to start a digital garden.  A meandering path of thought and a way to figure out certain aspects of my life.  
The goal is to create "plots" around the tagging system in Astro and from there collect my thoughts and notes as I have 
them.  I'm not expecting to do much in the beginning but as I collect links, notes, and hopefully strive to journal 
more, I can foster and grow the plots.
